Sparse Network And Component (SNAC) Analysis is a network analysis devloped to estimate partial correlations between variables from two different data domains/blocks/sources. Instead of treating data from multiple domains as a single data block (as many other network estimation methods do), SNAC explicitly takes the data's multi-domain structure into account. By using a component analysis step SNAC separates the domain-specific variance from the cross-domain variance; the latter is then used to estimate corss-domain partial correlations without the generally dominering influence of the domain-specific partial correlations. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of SNACR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("PiaTio/SNACR")
library(SNACR)
```

## Example

A tutorial on how to use SNACR package can be found in Tio, P., Van Deun, K., Waldorp, L.J., & Borsboom, D. (2026). Sparse Network And Component Analysis: A Tutorial on estimating Cross-Domain Networks. (Manuscript submitted for publication).
